                <p>
                    The Bridge Network provides a layer of trust between Bridge Passports and faciliates communication between known passports. 
                    Bridge Network and Bridge Marketplace partners are vetted and registered with the network, while bad actor passports are blacklisted to prevent abuse. 
                    Network fees are paid to the network in the form of Bridge Token in exchange for the layer of trust and communication between users and partners.
                    The Bridge Network also facilitates all cross-blockchain Token Swaps while also providing an innovative dual-signature process for blockchain publishing making all published verified claims tamper-proof and secure.

                <p>
                    In order to build and use their digital identity, users need their personal information to be verified and digitally signed so it can be imported into their Bridge Passport as verified claims.
                    The Bridge Marketplace is an area of the Bridge Network that allows users to quickly and easily find trusted partners providing verification services on the Bridge Network. Any third-party vendor that is vetted by Bridge is able to integrate with the Bridge Marketplace and provide their verification services to the network in exchange for Bridge Tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The premier identity verification service on the Bridge Marketplace is the service provided by Bridge Protocol Corporation that leverages the cutting edge AI-assisted Aver (<a href="#" style="color: rgba(52,139,201,1);" onclick="window.open('https://www.goaver.com');">www.goaver.com</a>) platform to verify user identity to satisfy current domestic and international Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance requirements.

                <p>
                    Bridge Token is the currency of the Bridge Marketplace and Bridge Network that allows users to take advantage of cutting-edge features and services on the network.
                    To maximize utility and availability, Bridge Token exists as a hybrid cross-chain token on both the Neo and Ethereum blockchain networks. 
                    Users can quickly and easily swap their tokens between blockchain networks using their Bridge Passport Browser Extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bridge Token is available on some of the most popular and innovative decentralized exchanges and liquidity providers on both the Ethereum and Neo blockchain networks:

                <h3>Bridge Verified Claims</h3>
                <p>
                    Our digital identity is built from pieces of information called claims.  A claim can be a name, date of birth, locale, or any other identifying information about an individual.  
                    In order for a claim to be valid, a trusted third party must verify and certify the information is valid before a digital claim can be issued and signed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bridge Network offers an innovative dual-signature architecture that ensures that any claim published to the blockchain has been verified by Bridge for not only integrity and tamper-proofing, but also that it was issued by a known passport on the network before the claim can be relayed and committed to the blockchain.

                <p>
                    The Bridge Identity Platform was built from the ground up to be blockchain agnostic.  
                    The platform and SDK can be extended to take full advantage of any blockchain that provides smart contract functionality for publishing verified claims.
                    Currently Bridge Identity fully supports the Ethereum and Neo blockchain networks, with the potential to be extended to other networks in the future.

                                Any blockchain token must adhere to standards to be interoperable with other blockchain applications.  The ticker symbol for Bridge Token is BRDG, and exists as a cross-chain hybrid token, meaning it can exist and be swapped between multiple blockchains for use in different applications.  The total supply of BRDG remains consistent across blockchains and can move freely across chains using the Bridge Network.
