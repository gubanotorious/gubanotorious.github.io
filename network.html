                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bridge Network provides a layer of trust between Bridge Passports and faciliates communication between known passports to create the Bridge Marketplace. 
                    Network and verification partners are vetted and registered with the network as known passports, and bad actor passports are blacklisted to prevent abuse. 
                    Network fees are paid to the network in the form of Bridge Token in exchange for the layer of trust and communication between users and partners.
                    The Bridge Network also facilitates all cross-blockchain Token Swaps as well as providing an innovative dual-signature process for blockchain publishing of verified claims for added security and confidence.

                <p>
                    The Bridge Marketplace is an area of the Bridge Network that allows users to find trusted Bridge Marketplace partners on the Bridge Network. 
                    Bridge Marketplace partners can provide services to verify user information and provide verified claims in exchange for payment in Bridge Token. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bridge Marketplace allows any third party verification provider to provide their services on the network in exchange for Bridge Token.
                    The premier identity verification partner on the network is the Bridge Protocol Corporation provider that leverages the cutting edge AI-assisted Aver (<a href="#" style="color: rgba(52,139,201,1);" onclick="window.open('https://www.goaver.com');">www.goaver.com</a>) platform to verify user identity to satisfy current international KYC and AML compliance requirements.

                <p>
                    Bridge Token is the currency of the Bridge Marketplace that allows users to take advantage of cutting-edge features and services on the Bridge Network.
                    To maximize utility and availability, Bridge Token exists as a hybrid cross-chain token that exists on both Neo and Ethereum blockchain networks. Users can quickly and easily swap their Bridge Tokens between blockchain networks to allow them to be used in a wider range of distributed applications across both ecosystems.

                <h3>Bridge Verified Claims</h3>
                <p>
                    Our digital identity is built from pieces of information called claims.  A claim can be a name, date of birth, locale, or any other identifying information about an individual.  
                    In order for a claim to be valid, a trusted third party must verify and certify the information is valid before a digital claim can be issued and signed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bridge Network offers an innovative dual-signature architecture that ensures that any claim published to the blockchain has been verified by Bridge for not only integrity and tamper-proofing, but also that it was issued by a known passport on the network before the claim can be relayed and committed to the blockchain.

                <p>
                    The Bridge Identity Platform was built from the ground up to be blockchain agnostic.  
                    The platform and SDK can be extended to take full advantage of any blockchain that provides smart contract functionality for publishing verified claims.
                    Currently Bridge Identity fully supports the Ethereum and Neo blockchain networks, with the potential to be extended to other networks in the future.

Claims such as age, location, and other anonymous information critical for compliance and authorization can be published to their blockchain address for verification by any third-party blockchain distributed applications.

                                Any blockchain token must adhere to standards to be interoperable with other blockchain applications.  The ticker symbol for Bridge Token is BRDG, and exists as a cross-chain hybrid token, meaning it can exist and be swapped between multiple blockchains for use in different applications.  The total supply of BRDG remains consistent across blockchains and can move freely across chains using the Bridge Network.
