                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Bridge Identity is a unique approach to sovereign identity that is ideal for securely managing, and transmitting digital identity.  
                    With Bridge Identity, users are in total control of their data and only provide the data they choose.
                    Bridge Identity is fully portable allowing for online, offline, and blockchain-based identity verification options. There are several flexible options to accept Bridge Identity for any application or real-world use case.
                    The framework was built and open-sourced to bring sovereign digital identity to the community. The core SDK, integration components, and end-user clients are all available on GitHub and free to use in all of your applications.

                <h3>What is Self-Sovereign Identity?</h3>
                <p>Sovereign as an adjective is defined as "possessed of supreme power", "unlimited in extent", and "enjoying autonomy", often used in reference to a supreme ruler or king.  
                    Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the idea that individuals and organizations have complete ownership of their identity and complete control of their personal data.  
                    As we move to a more digital existence, being able to properly implement these concepts has become more important than ever.
                    Some of the key components of making this possible in the digital realm are:</p>
