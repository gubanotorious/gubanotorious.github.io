                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Bridge Identity is a unique approach to sovereign identity that is ideal for securely managing, and transmitting digital identity.  
                    Users are empowered to be in total control and have the power to only disclose their identifying data when and with whom they choose.
                    Since Bridge Identity is fully portable, it also provides several online, offline, and blockchain-based identity verification options with added flexibility to accept Bridge Identity in any application or real-world use case.
                    The framework was built and open-sourced to bring sovereign digital identity to the community with the core SDK, integration components, and end-user clients available and free to use in all of your software and hardware applications.

                <h3>What is Self-Sovereign Identity?</h3>
                <p>Sovereign as an adjective is defined as "possessed of supreme power", "unlimited in extent", and "enjoying autonomy", often used in reference to a supreme ruler or king.  
                    Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the idea that individuals and organizations have complete ownership of their identity and complete control of their personal data.  
                    As we move to a more digital existence, being able to properly implement these concepts has become more important than ever.
                    Some of the key components of making this possible in the digital realm are:</p>
